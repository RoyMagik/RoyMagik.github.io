<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 0.9em; color: #555;">This project addressed the challenge of mechanical arm calibration in industrial automation by proposing a system that combines ultrasonic microarrays with deep learning. As the project leader, I was responsible for organizing experimental operations, data analysis, and writing the final report. The system utilizes components such as a signal generator, SW-M221 field-effect transistor module, LM386 audio amplifier board module, AD7606 chip, and Raspberry Pi. This national-level innovation project has been successfully concluded, and a related patent has been publicly disclosed.</p>
