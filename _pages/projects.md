    <b style="color: #4a4a83;">EyeCAD: Eye-tracking Assisted CAD Interaction</b>
    <br>
    <p>
      Developed an engineering prototype that integrates an eye-tracking device with a CAD system 
      to improve humanâ€“computer interaction. The system allows users to quickly locate and zoom into 
      specific regions of a CAD model using gaze information. 
      I implemented the data capture pipeline from the Tobii eye tracker, built the mapping algorithm 
      to synchronize gaze with 3D viewport operations, and deployed a plugin that runs inside Autodesk Fusion 360.

  <div>
    <b style="color: #4a4a83;">Smart Factory Monitoring Dashboard</b>
    <br>
    <p>
      Designed and deployed a lightweight monitoring system for factory equipment, integrating 
      sensor data (temperature, vibration, workload) into a real-time dashboard. 
      I was responsible for building the backend data collection service in Python, 
      connecting it to MQTT brokers, and implementing a React-based frontend to display live metrics. 
      The system was successfully tested on a production line for anomaly detection and early warning.

    <b style="color: #4a4a83;">Campus Utility App</b>
    <br>
    <p>
      Built a mobile app for students to access course schedules, announcements, and group collaboration tools. 
      The app was developed with Flutter for cross-platform support, with Firebase providing authentication 
      and cloud storage. I implemented the user login system, notification push service, and database schema. 
      The app was deployed for internal use among 200+ students.
