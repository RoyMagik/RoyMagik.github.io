# About Me

I am a Master's student at **Xidian University**, focusing on short video generation. Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology at **Zhejiang University of Technology**, where I was part of the top 1% innovation experimental class. My research primarily revolves around **deep learning, computer vision, and AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content)**, with a particular emphasis on large models like LLM and Stable Diffusion, including Lora and ControlNet. I have hands-on experience in implementing and understanding these models at a fundamental level. My achievements include authoring publications in Chinese journals and conferences, having a JCR Q2 paper under review, and holding a patent. I also led a national-level innovation project. I am open to various forms of academic collaboration and welcome contact via email: 1821698873@qq.com

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 0.9em; color: #555;">This project addressed the challenge of mechanical arm calibration in industrial automation by proposing a system that combines ultrasonic microarrays with deep learning. As the project leader, I was responsible for organizing experimental operations, data analysis, and writing the final report. The system utilizes components such as a signal generator, SW-M221 field-effect transistor module, LM386 audio amplifier board module, AD7606 chip, and Raspberry Pi. This national-level innovation project has been successfully concluded, and a related patent has been publicly disclosed.</p>
