# About Me

I am currently pursuing my Master's degree at **Xidian University**, with a primary research focus on short video generation. Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology at **Zhejiang University of Technology**, where I was part of the Jianxing Honors College. My research interests broadly encompass **deep learning, computer vision, large language models (LLMs), and AIGC (AI-generated content)**. I have gained in-depth practical experience with Stable Diffusion, including LoRA and ControlNet models, and have authored publications, including one Chinese journal paper, one Chinese conference paper, and one JCR Q2 journal paper currently under review, alongside a granted patent. I am open to various forms of academic collaboration and welcome contact via email: 1821698873@qq.com
