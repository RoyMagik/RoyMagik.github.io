# About Me

I am a Master's student at **Xidian University**, specializing in short video generation. Previously, I earned my Bachelor's degree from **Zhejiang University of Technology**, where I focused on Computer Science and Technology. My research primarily involves deep learning and computer vision, with a current emphasis on LLM and AIGC large models. I have a deep understanding of Stable Diffusion, including Lora and ControlNet models, and possess practical experience in these areas. I have led multiple team projects during my undergraduate studies, demonstrating strong communication and teamwork skills. My achievements include one Chinese journal publication, one Chinese conference paper, one JCR Q2 journal paper under review, one patent, and leadership of one national-level innovation project. I am open to various forms of academic collaboration and welcome contact via email: 1821698873@qq.com
