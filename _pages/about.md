# About Me

I am a Master's student at Xidian University, specializing in short video generation. Previously, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Zhejiang University of Technology, where I was part of the Jianxing Honors College (top 1% innovation experimental class). My research primarily focuses on deep learning and computer vision, with a current emphasis on LLM and AIGC large models. I have a deep understanding of Stable Diffusion, including LoRA and ControlNet models, and possess practical experience in their application. I have served as a team leader on multiple undergraduate projects, demonstrating strong communication and teamwork skills. My achievements include one Chinese journal paper, one Chinese conference paper, one JCR Q2 paper under review, one patent, and leading one national-level innovation project. I am open to various forms of academic collaboration and welcome contact via email: 1821698873@qq.com
