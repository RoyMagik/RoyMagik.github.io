# About Me

I am a Master's student at Xi'an University of Electronic Science and Technology, focusing on short video generation. Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University of Technology, where I was part of the Jianxing Honors College (top 1% innovation experimental class). My research interests lie in deep learning and computer vision, with a particular focus on LLMs and AIGC large models. I have practical experience and a deep understanding of Stable Diffusion, including LoRA and ControlNet models. I have led multiple team projects, demonstrating strong communication and teamwork skills. My achievements include one Chinese journal publication, one Chinese conference paper, one JCR Q2 paper under review, one patent, and leading one national-level innovation project. I am open to various forms of academic collaboration and welcome contact via email: 1821698873@qq.com
