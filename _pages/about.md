# About Me

I am a Master's student at **Xidian University**, focusing on short video generation. I previously earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from **Zhejiang University of Technology**, where I was part of the Jianxing Honors College (top 1% innovation experimental class). My research primarily revolves around deep learning and computer vision, with a current deep dive into LLM and AIGC large models. I possess a thorough understanding of Stable Diffusion, including LoRA and ControlNet models, backed by practical experience. I have led multiple team projects during my undergraduate studies, demonstrating strong communication and teamwork skills. My academic contributions include one accepted Chinese journal paper, one accepted Chinese conference paper, one JCR Q2 journal paper under review, one patent, and leadership of one completed national-level innovation project. I am open to various forms of academic collaboration and welcome contact via email: **1821698873@qq.com**.
