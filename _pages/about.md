# About Me

I am a Master's student at Xi'an University of Electronic Science and Technology, focusing on short video generation. Previously, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Zhejiang University of Technology, ranking 5th out of 131 students with a GPA of 3.92/5.00. My research primarily involves deep learning and computer vision, with a particular interest in LLMs and AIGC large models. I have hands-on experience and a deep understanding of Stable Diffusion, including LoRA and ControlNet. I have led multiple team projects, demonstrating strong communication and teamwork skills. My academic contributions include one Chinese journal paper, one Chinese conference paper, one JCR Q2 journal paper under review, and one patent. I also led a successfully concluded national-level innovation project. I am open to various forms of academic collaboration and welcome contact via email: 1821698873@qq.com
