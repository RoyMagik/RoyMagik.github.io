# About Me

I am a Master's student at Xidian University, focusing on short video generation, and previously earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Zhejiang University of Technology (ranked 5/131 with a GPA of 3.9222/5.00). My research primarily involves deep learning and computer vision, with a current emphasis on LLMs and AIGC large models, particularly the underlying principles and practical applications of Stable Diffusion, including LoRA and ControlNet. I have led multiple team projects, demonstrating strong communication and teamwork skills. My academic contributions include one Chinese journal paper, one Chinese conference paper, one JCR Q2 journal paper under review, one patent, and successful leadership of a national-level university innovation project. I am open to various forms of academic collaboration and welcome contact via email: 1821698873@qq.com
