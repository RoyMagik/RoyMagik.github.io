# About Me

I am a Master's student at **Xidian University**, specializing in short video generation. Previously, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from **Zhejiang University of Technology**, where I was part of the top 1% innovation experimental class with a GPA of 3.92/5.00. My research focuses on deep learning and computer vision, with a particular interest in LLMs and AIGC large models. I have a deep understanding of Stable Diffusion, including LoRA and ControlNet models, and have practical experience in their application. I have successfully led multiple team projects, demonstrating strong communication and teamwork skills. My academic contributions include one Chinese journal publication, one Chinese conference paper, one JCR Q2 journal paper under review, one patent, and leadership of one national-level innovation project. I am open to various forms of academic collaboration and welcome contact via email: 1821698873@qq.com
