# About Me

I am currently pursuing my Master's degree at **Xidian University**, focusing on short video generation. Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology at **Zhejiang University of Technology**, where I was part of the Jianxing Honors College (top 1% innovation experimental class). My research primarily revolves around deep learning and computer vision, with a particular interest in LLM and AIGC large models. I possess in-depth understanding and practical experience with Stable Diffusion, including LoRA and ControlNet models. I have served as a team leader on multiple projects during my undergraduate studies, demonstrating strong communication and teamwork skills. My achievements include one Chinese journal publication, one Chinese conference paper, one JCR Q2 paper under review, one patent, and leading one national-level innovation project. I am open to various forms of academic collaboration and welcome contact via email: 1821698873@qq.com
