# About Me

I am a Master's student at Xi'an University of Electronic Science and Technology, with a research focus on short video generation. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Zhejiang University of Technology, where I graduated in the top 1% of my class. My research background includes deep learning and computer vision, with in-depth experience in LLM and AIGC large models, particularly Stable Diffusion, Lora, and ControlNet. I have led multiple projects, demonstrating strong communication and teamwork skills. My academic contributions include one Chinese journal publication, one Chinese conference paper, one JCR Q2 journal paper under review, and one patent. I also led a national-level innovation project. I am open to various forms of academic collaboration and welcome contact via email: 1821698873@qq.com
